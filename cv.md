3. I fell in love with android development more then 1 month ago, and since that day I do my best to improve my skills every day. On this way I`ve had really a lot of troubles and achievements and I am more proud of my failures, because they gave me my best experience, they helped me develop the ability to be greatful for criticism and the ability to analyze myself. During this time I`ve had experience with such technologies as Java, Kotlin, C#, C# Xamarin, Unity, Javascript, Git (and of course GitHub), UI Design with Photoshop. My main achievement is a constant desire to improve my technical and soft skills, to be a better person in my private life and work.

I am a communicative, self-confident, punctual, ambitious, motivated, stress-resistant person, who can easily work with a team of developers. I also think that my virtue is an ability to relax and disconnect my brain from problems, so I can restore my energy, for me it`s extremely significant.

I`m sure that EPAM will find a team member, soul-mate in me and will help me to reveal my potential. I want to work in EPAM because I have a desire to work in a friendly atmosphere with professionals, with interesting people, I want to grow with this company and I`m confident that I will. The main reason I chose EPAM? I have a desire to grow as a person and professional and I know that this company provides all possible opportunities to its employees.
